Thy 『DUKE』! the Virtuoso!

Currently Updating some of my stuff, but keep an eye out! I work on Several things:

I practice C# and Cybersecurity – I also mess around on Unity

I also work on 3d modeling and animation, usually on Blender (my beloved)

And ocassionally i Write, usually for projects that revolve around Unity and Blender; but they are stories in their own right.

My works will be put up here shortly, but again, This account is just on standby until I finish some backend work.
