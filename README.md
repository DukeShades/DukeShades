**Thy 『 DUKE 』, the Shade of future I would have left for myself...**

If you require, one can pursue me on the following...

Gmail: mystuffzforgood@gmail.com (I don't ever check this, but hey, it exists)

<br>

Eventually, I'll leave a gallery of some of my works on here, but the road has not forked those branches nigh.

# About Me.
<sub> to be honest, that's the reason you're reading this isn't it?</sub>

<br>

Witness, I am but a humble lad; For I have been conjured upon the vicissitudes of this world past the prime of dawn upon 2009— within the realm of Unisted States, beneath the magistrate of a sun-scorched marsh, braizened with deluge and cyclones: Florida.

<br>

Me, that I am, are but a male who wish for naught but a singularity from my own hands. I was once told, as I would percieve you have also, to invoke an artifice of my own ideal— a prompt I set to follow, for it dawned the first stone of many.

<br>

The fathoms that I have arrived from have not left me alone, for I was awarded two valiant 'soldiers' to be forced into all my shenanigans... One of which probably linked you here (Hello Plazma). These fellow striders have been ~~forcibly~~ graced to walk alongside my cojured artery, and I revere their participation in such.

<br>

Now, for if you were to gaze past the deliberately, excessively worded paragraph:

* I am a 16 Year-old guy from the US-Florida.
* I like making things because I feel like it's the genteel thing to do.
* I have two siblings: my puerile sister, and my venerable older brother.

You may go on to read the rest of such an "About Me." if you are to index more data of oneself.

## Hobbies & "Work"

As i would hope for every other person; I have things I like to do. My main two include 3D modeling and Computer Science— from there, has sprouted many other small things I do, such as writing and drawing. For my own purposes, I'll shorthand it into two main categories, then explain anything that's related to the main topic in its own sub category.

<br> <br>

#### Blender
3D art, everybody starts with Blender for that, no? I've used Blender on and off for quite a while... I've never been *good* at it, but I love it none-theless. My main interests were always Animation, and the general scenery you obtain from a model when imposed to a drawing... which would've been nice if I could avoid said drawing, but UV's seem to thwart my plans on staying pencil pure.

<br>
By order, I mostly like (or want to) model: Humanoids/Clothes; Weapons/Tools; Environments; and then other Creatures... I myself, have OCs that I think would be fun to model.

<br>

As of 2024, I've really started to get back into blender; I've worked a bit on Environments, and got a bit more experience with tools, but towards the end of 2025, I've really been trying to work on Humanoids, so I've been on a ceaseless practice grinding between modeling and anatomy. So far, Majority of the body is pretty easy; hands can be annoying, but aren't that bad; then there is the head. I hate the head— I have been of no "success" in making a head to my liking, but I'll go until I have.

<br>

My accension rite or creation will be when I am to finally slay "lord Egenium"— a roblox screenshot of the egg-hunt eggs, which I found funny enough to leave as my Profile pic on most sites like Discord.

<br> <br>

#### Unity & Development
I've lumped these two together because we all know thats the right thing to do. I've touched Unity so many times, at so many different points in my life. It all came down after my brother had shown me scratch— and suddenly, one day, I had wanted to make *real* games of my own. 9 Years... that's the age of my first Unity project; it was a ball obby, probably scrapped together by following a tutorial alongside my brother. I still find excitement in trying to piece scrambled knowledge together.

<br>

As of today, I have *far* too many goals in Computer Science. For a while, I wanted to do Gamedev, One day it would be web-dev, then it changed to OPSEC... but I really do think Gamedev will be the final destination, or the most important one, this time around.

<br>

This messy dabbling in way to many different parts of CS has definetly made me an unfocused catasrophy when it comes to actual knowledge and application of such data... but I've been working on it.

<br>

Last year was the most productive effort on that front, I've gone ahead and fully engaged myself in Python for a bit— not having to many projects on my own from it, most notably being a macro i had made for something; but after such, I've been doing CS50 and hope to complete it before February.

<br>

Once I get a concrete grasp of CS, wthout relying on the strands of information I've scoured over fleeting years; I'll move back onto Unity and hopefully finish a few mechanic pieces, before inevitably starting on some project.

### Hobbies 2 / Interests

Aside from those main two, I like writing. I have one piece I mainly work on, "Humerra". It's an ancient project that had spanned from a game I used to pretend with my Brother— "VX".

<br>

I work on both VX and Humerra now... VX persisting because I had been re-formatting the chaotic story that a pair of 6 and 8 year olds made into a DnD session. It's been a fun project for me to practice writting on a story i care *slightly less* about, and Its motivated me to do a lot in terms of development... whilst also giving me a small time pressure that theoretically exists.

<br> <br> <br>

I Have some other things I do, mostly playing games. My Favorite is Terraria (1.4.5 is just a week away!), but I've been playing a lot more as of recent...

* Limbus Company 
* Risk of Rain
* Deltarune
* Hollow Knight
* Roblox (I should specify *what* on Roblox, as this is about as concise as saying "Steam"... but I'm lazy)

Just to name the most consistant ones right now. I personally like challenging games, and will probably be taking more upon myself as time goes one. I've been wanting to play Elden Ring for example.


<br> <br> <br>

I also practice Japanese... on occassion, I've been getting better at being consistant. But I possess the notable problem of not wanting to be observed whilst I practice— which gets in the way quite frequently.

<br> <hr> <br>

Yay! you now posses an Index of Information about me, infomation I felt was unimportant enough to get a general understanding of— yet not a precise image of me... You can do whatever you were intending to do with such. If you've read this far– you'll probably check out my soon-to-exsist projects and images. Have fun, feel free to say Hello; I'm quite contempt on figuring out why somebody is messaging me, so please do state a guise if you end up reaching out for some noble reason.
